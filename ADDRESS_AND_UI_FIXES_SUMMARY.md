# Address and UI Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed âœ…

### 1. **Category Buttons Made Brighter and More Visible**
- **Problem**: Category buttons (Laundry, Iron, Men's Dry, etc.) looked dull and hard to see
- **Solution**: 
  - Added vibrant colors with `bg-laundrify-blue/80` for unselected states
  - Added borders, shadows, and better hover effects
  - Made selected states more prominent with `bg-white` and shadows
  - Applied to both mobile and desktop versions
- **Files Modified**: `src/components/ResponsiveLaundryHome.tsx`

### 2. **FIRST30 Coupon Fixed - Now One-Time Use Only**
- **Problem**: Users could use FIRST30 coupon multiple times after first order
- **Solution**:
  - Created comprehensive `CouponService` with proper usage tracking
  - Implemented `markCouponAsUsed()` function that stores usage in localStorage
  - Added validation to check if coupon has been used before
  - Integrated with order completion flow to mark coupons as used
- **Files Created**: `src/services/couponService.ts`
- **Files Modified**: `src/components/LaundryCart.tsx`

### 3. **NEW10 Coupon Fixed - Now Works Properly**
- **Problem**: NEW10 coupon wasn't working correctly
- **Solution**:
  - Fixed coupon validation logic in the new `CouponService`
  - Added proper first-order exclusion logic
  - Improved error messages for better user feedback
  - Validated against order amount and user eligibility
- **Result**: NEW10 now works for non-first orders as intended

### 4. **Address Editing Fixed - No More Search Box Issues**
- **Problem**: When editing saved addresses, the full address went into search box making it difficult to edit individual fields
- **Solution**:
  - Modified `ZomatoAddAddressPage.tsx` to populate individual form fields instead of search box
  - When editing, now fills: flatNo, street, landmark, area, pincode separately
  - Keeps search box empty during editing for better UX
  - Added debug logging to track editing process
- **Files Modified**: `src/components/ZomatoAddAddressPage.tsx`

### 5. **Saved Addresses Loading Fixed**
- **Problem**: Previously saved addresses weren't showing for users
- **Solution**:
  - Improved address loading logic to use `AddressService` with better error handling
  - Added session management integration for proper authentication
  - Enhanced debugging with detailed logging
  - Created fallback mechanisms for offline scenarios
  - Fixed address transformation from backend to frontend format
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `src/components/ZomatoAddressSelector.tsx`
  - `src/services/addressService.ts` (already updated in previous session)
