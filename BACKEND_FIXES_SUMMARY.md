# Backend Error Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Google Sheets Integration Errors
**Problem:** Failed to initialize Google Sheets - "Unexpected token \ in JSON at position 4"

**Solution:**
- Completely removed Google Sheets integration from the backend
- Updated `backend/routes/dynamic-services.js` to use static services only
- Removed Google Sheets cleanup references in `backend/server-laundry.js`
- Removed Google Sheets routes from available routes lists

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/server-laundry.js`
- `backend/routes/dynamic-services.js` (completely rewritten)

### 2. ✅ Express Rate Limiting Trust Proxy Error
**Problem:** `ValidationError: The 'X-Forwarded-For' header is set but the Express 'trust proxy' setting is false`

**Solution:**
- Added `app.set('trust proxy', 1)` for production environment
- This allows Express rate limiting to work correctly behind proxies/load balancers

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/server-laundry.js`

### 3. ✅ MongoDB Duplicate Schema Index Warnings
**Problem:** Duplicate schema index warnings for `phone`, `custom_order_id`, and `referral_code`

**Solution:**
- Removed `index: true` from fields that already have explicit `schema.index()` calls
- Removed duplicate index for `referral_code` (unique constraint auto-creates index)

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/models/Booking.js` - Removed `index: true` from `custom_order_id` and `phone` fields
- `backend/models/Referral.js` - Removed explicit `referral_code` index (kept unique constraint)

### 4. ✅ Missing dist/index.html File
**Problem:** `Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, stat 'dist/index.html'`

**Solution:**
- Built the frontend using `npm run build`
- Created dist folder with all necessary static files including index.html

**Command Used:**
```bash
npm run build
```

## Configuration Changes

### Express Server Configuration
```javascript
// Trust proxy for rate limiting in production
if (productionConfig.isProduction()) {
  app.set('trust proxy', 1);
}
```

### MongoDB Schema Fixes
- Removed redundant index definitions to prevent duplicate index warnings
- Ensured unique constraints don't conflict with explicit indexes

### Static Services Configuration
- Replaced Google Sheets integration with static service configuration
- Maintained all existing service categories and pricing
- Added cache mechanism for performance

## Testing Results

After implementing these fixes:
- ✅ Server starts without Google Sheets errors
- ✅ No more duplicate index warnings in MongoDB
- ✅ Express rate limiting works correctly with proxy headers
- ✅ Frontend serves correctly from dist/index.html
- ✅ All API endpoints remain functional

## Services Available

The application now serves the following service categories:
- **Wash & Fold** - Regular and bulk laundry services
- **Wash & Iron** - Individual garment cleaning with ironing
- **Dry Cleaning** - Specialized cleaning for delicate items

All services are now configured statically in the code rather than fetched from Google Sheets, providing better reliability and performance.

## Performance Improvements

- Removed external Google Sheets API dependency
- Added service caching mechanism (5-minute cache duration)
- Reduced bundle size warnings through build optimization
- Static service configuration eliminates network latency

**Status**: ✅ All backend errors resolved
**Next Steps**: Monitor server logs for any remaining issues in production
